# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning is generating a description for a particular image description for a particular image. 
I have used a concept of transfer learning for extracting Image features and Learning the Word Embeddings.
Transfer Learning Models used:
1. IncetionV3 (Extract Image Features)
2. Glove6B.100d (100 dim Word Embedding)
